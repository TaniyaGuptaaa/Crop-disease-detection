            Our mission is to enhance apple farming by leveraging cutting-edge technology to detect diseases in apple crops 
            early and accurately. Utilizing the power of deep learning,LLMs and the ResNet-50 model, our project aims to identify some
            apple diseases, ensuring that farmers can take timely actions to protect their crops and maximize yield.

            <b>Why This Project?</b>
            Apple farming is a critical sector of agriculture, and diseases can significantly impact crop quality and yield. 
            Traditional methods of disease detection are often time-consuming and require expert knowledge.
            Our project aims to simplify this process by providing an automated, reliable, and quick solution for identifying apple diseases.

            <b>How It Works</b>
            Data Collection: We gather a vast dataset of apple images, including healthy apples and those affected by various diseases.
            Model Training: Using the ResNet-50 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network, we train our model to 
            recognize patterns and features associated with different apple diseases.
            Detection: The trained model can then analyze new apple images and accurately predict the presence of diseases,
            helping farmers to take necessary actions promptly.

            <b>Our Vision</b>
            We envision a future where technology and agriculture work hand in hand. By providing farmers with advanced tools for disease detection,
            we hope to contribute to healthier crops, and more efficient farming practices.
